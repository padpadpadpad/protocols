# DanPadLab protocols

## Outline

This is a collection of protocols useful we use for doing things in the DanPadLab. Some are lab-based and some are computational. The motivation is to try be as open as possible about the methods we use, and document them to make onboarding new lab members easier, while also making collaboration with other labs easier.

## Contributing

We would love for you to contribute to this repository! If you are a member of DanPadLab, you can come talk to me in person! If not, please open an issue [here](https://github.com/padpadpadpad/protocols/issues).

## How to use this repository

We try and write all the protocols in Quarto, a markdown-like format that is easy to read and write. These are easy to write and can be converted to HTML, PDF, and other formats.

A great resource to understand how to use GitHub and R is the [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/) book. It has not been completely updated for use with Positron, but the principles are mainly the same.

1. Clone the repository.
2. Download the repository into your local computer.
3. [Positron](https://positron.posit.co/) is a great way to view the a GitHub repoitory and edit Quarto and R files. You can also use [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) if you prefer. Open the folder in Positron or RStudio.
4. Open the file you want to edit. Make changes. Positron and RStudio have a built-in preview feature that allows you to see how the document will look when rendered.
5. Save and commit your changes. In both RStudio and Positron you can do this interactively in the IDE.
6. Push your changes to the repository.
7. Open a pull request on GitHub. This will allow us to review your changes and merge them into the main branch.
